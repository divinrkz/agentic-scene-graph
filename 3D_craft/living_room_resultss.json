{"prompt": "Create a living room with dimensions 4 x 2 x 3 meters. Include 3 sofas, 3 couches, 3 lamps, a standing bookshelf, and a plant. Position furniture logically with proper spacing and accessibility.", "score": "0.85", "question_1": "\"Does the second sofa (sofa2) overlap with the second lamp (lamp2) in the image?\"", "answer_1": "No. Sofa 2 and lamp 2 occupy completely different parts of the scene, so their regions do not overlap. In pixel terms, sofa 2 ends around x\u2248650, while lamp 2 begins at x\u2248950, so there\u2019s a clear gap between them.", "question_2": "Is the 'sofa1' overlapping with the 'lamp1' in the generated room?", "answer_2": "No. In the rendered scene sofa1 and lamp1 do not overlap. The lamp sits just behind the sofa, but their volumes (and their 2D projections) remain separate."}
