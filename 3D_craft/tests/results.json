All three pieces of furniture lie within the room\u2019s bounds.  \n3. The lamp sits appropriately on the desk surface and is contained within the desk footprint, satisfying the \u201clamp inside desk\u201d constraint.  \n4. The bed-to-desk X-offset constraint (0.6 m) is not met: the bed at X=0.5 m and desk at X=2.5 m are 2.0 m apart instead of 0.6 m.  \n\nBecause only one of two spatial constraints is fulfilled, the scene earns a middling score of 4.0 out of 10."

                    "answer": "1. Desk position vs. bed foot  \n- The 4 m wall along Y=0 (wall_1) is indeed where the desk sits: after a 90\u00b0 Z-rotation its footprint runs from Y\u2248\u20130.1 to Y\u22481.1, abutting the Y=0 wall.  \n- The bed, oriented with its 0.9 m depth along Y and nominally against the opposite wall, has its \u201cfoot\u201d edge at Y = 1 \u2013 0.9/2 = 0.55 m (or if you treat the far side as headboard it\u2019s at Y = 1 + 0.9/2 = 1.45 m).  Either way the closest approach between bed and desk is \u2265 0.55 m, which exceeds the 0.5 m requirement.  \n\n2. Lamp on desk  \n- Desk top surface is at Z = desk_center_z + \u00bd\u00b7desk_height = 0.375 + 0.375 = 0.75 m.  \n- Lamp\u2019s base sits at Z = lamp_center_z \u2013 \u00bd\u00b7lamp_height = 0.90 \u2013 0.15 = 0.75 m.  \n- In X/Y the lamp\u2019s [2.8, 0.6] lies inside the desk footprint ([2.2\u20132.8]\u00d7[\u20130.1\u20131.1]).  \n\nConclusion: Yes\u2014the desk is flush to one 4 m wall and at least 0.5 m from the bed\u2019s foot, and the lamp is correctly placed on the desk."

                "question_3": {
                    "question": "Is the bed aligned along one of the 4-meter walls with at least 0.5 m clearance on both sides, the desk along the opposite 4-meter wall leaving at least 1 m of walkway space, and the lamp placed on the desk?",
                    "answer": "No. Here\u2019s why each requirement fails:\n\n1. Bed placement  \n   - The bed\u2019s center is at x=0.5 m, y=1.0 m with no rotation. Its half\u2010width along X is 1.9/2 = 0.95 m, so it actually spans from x\u2248\u20130.45 m to x\u22481.45 m. It isn\u2019t flush against either 4\u2009m wall (y = 0 or y = 2), and there isn\u2019t the required 0.5 m clearance on both sides\u2014part of it even lies outside the room.\n\n2. Desk placement  \n   - The desk is rotated 90\u00b0 about Z, so its 1.2 m \u201cwidth\u201d runs along Y and 0.6 m \u201cdepth\u201d along X. Centered at (2.5,\u20090.5), it spans y\u2248\u20130.1 m to 1.1 m, so it protrudes past the y=0 wall instead of sitting flush against the opposite 4 m wall, and you don\u2019t get a 1 m clear walkway.\n\n3. Lamp placement  \n   - This one is actually correct: the lamp\u2019s z-center of 0.9 m puts its base on the desk surface (0.75 m high), and its x\u2013y footprint lies within the desk\u2019s bounds according to the JSON \u201cinside\u201d constraint.\n\nBecause the bed and desk aren\u2019t positioned against opposite 4 m walls with the required side and walkway clearances, the overall layout does not satisfy the specification."
                },
                "question_4": {
                    "question": "Is the bed positioned against one 4 m wall, the desk placed on the opposite 4 m wall leaving at least 0.5 m of walking space between them, and the lamp located on the desk?",
                    "answer": "Here\u2019s the breakdown against your three checks:\n\n1. Bed against a 4 m wall?  \n   - The room\u2019s long walls run at y = 0 and y = 2.  \n   - The bed\u2019s center is at y = 1.0 with a depth of 0.9 m, so its front\u2010to\u2010back span is 0.55 \u2192 1.45 m.  \n   - It sits roughly 0.55 m away from either 4 m wall.  \n   \u2192 Not flush against either long wall.\n\n2. Desk on the opposite 4 m wall with \u22650.5 m walking space between bed and desk?  \n   - The desk is rotated 90\u00b0 and centered at y = 0.5 m, with a half-depth along global Y of 0.6 m, so it runs roughly from y \u2248 \u20130.1 to 1.1 m. This abuts the wall at y = 0, so that part is okay.  \n   - The gap between the desk\u2019s far edge (y\u22481.1 m) and the bed\u2019s near edge (y\u22480.55 m) is actually \u20130.55 m (i.e. they overlap), so there is no 0.5 m walking corridor.  \n   \u2192 Fails the walking-space requirement.\n\n3. Lamp on the desk?  \n   - The lamp is centered at (x = 2.8, y = 0.6), which lies within the desk\u2019s footprint, and its base sits 0.15 m above the desktop.  \n   \u2192 Yes, the lamp is correctly on the desk.\n\nSummary: The lamp placement is correct, but the bed is not flush against a long wall and there is no 0.5 m walk\u2010through between bed and desk."
