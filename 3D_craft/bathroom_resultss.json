{"prompt": "Create a bathroom with dimensions 4 x 2 x 3 meters. Include 3 toilets, 3 bathtubs, 3 sinks, a mirror, and a shower. Position furniture logically with proper spacing and accessibility.", "score": "0.18", "question_1": "Is there any overlap between 'modern_toilet1' at position [0.7, 0, 0.8] and 'modern_sink1' at position [0.7, 1.9, 0.8] in the image?", "answer_1": "No\u2014they don\u2019t overlap. Both are centered at x=0.7 m and z=0.8 m (so they line up in width and height), but the sink is at y=1.9 m while the toilet is at y=0.0 m. Even allowing for each fixture being up to ~0.5 m\u20130.7 m deep, their centers are 1.9 m apart front-to-back, so their bounding boxes never intersect.", "question_2": "Is the \"modern_toilet1\" overlapping with the \"modern_toilet2\"?", "answer_2": "No. In the rendered scene you can clearly see modern_toilet1 on the left and modern_toilet2 on the right, and there\u2019s a visible gap between them. Neither their 3D meshes nor their projected 2D bounding boxes intersect, so they are not overlapping."}
